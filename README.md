Emission is custom game and rendering engine made in C# using OpenTk, a warper of OpenGL. 
Emission engine can run on Window/MacOS/Linux.
I'm currently using this engine to create my own game, and it grows by technicals stuff that I need. 

## Engine 
It's the main project use for rendering.
Rendering take his foundations on Modern OpenGL and GLFW. 
It uses faces arrays to render differents kinds of meshes. It also use pre-compiled statics meshes and debug rendering.
Emission cannot render bones animations but im working on this features.
