# Emission Engine

> Welcome to Emission !

**Emission Engine** is an open-source custom game and rendering engine made in C# using custom wrapper of OpenGL. 
Emission engine can **only run on Windows** but I'm working on engine's portability. 
I'm currently using this engine to create my own game, and it grows by adding the technical stuff that I need. 

This engine is not performant as Unity or Unreal but I'm trying to make nicer and nicer every days.

## How to install Emission ?

### Prerequisites
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone Emission's Repo.
2. [.NET 6.0 (or higher)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) ro run the engine.
3. [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/), a c# IDE (but Rider works too)
   - `.NET desktop development` with `.NET Framework 4.8`

### Import Emission
1. Open a new terminal, get to a directory and clone Emission with `git clone https://github.com/Earnest-Blade/Emission-Engine`.
   - You can also download as zip from github.
2. Open Visual Studio 2022 and create a new `Console Project`. Then, Solution -> Add -> Existing project and select `Emission Engine.csproj` in Emission's location.

### Shaders (GLSL)
In order to create shaders, you will need to learn GLSL. [Here is a good introduction](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Shaders) into OpenGL and shaders.
